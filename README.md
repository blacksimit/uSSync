# uSSync

uSSync,an user-friendly desktop application that aims to make Pardus (a Linux distro) users keep their USB storage devices easily synchronized and save time. Presents instant information regarding synchronization.

## Motivation
I am a freshman at Middle East Technical University. I wanted to spend my summer with participating in national software camp organized by [TUBITAK](https://www.tubitak.gov.tr/en) under supervision of my mentor.

## Installation && How To Run

There is a prerequisite to run uSSync, a python package named [pyinotify](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyinotify)

To install via pip, run `$ sudo pip install pyinotify`. After that is complete, we are ready to go.

- Clone the project, `git clone git@github.com:oguzhanunlu/uSSync.git`
- Go to directory, `cd uSSync`
- Run command `python ussync.py`
